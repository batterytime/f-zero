### This repo

In this repo are all the STLs you need to make an F-Zero, except for:
- Voron 0.0 or 0.1 parts, including gantry, toolhead, carriage retainers, and M2 nutbars
- optional corners to reuse 200mm extrusions (under development)
- Z endstop (see #micron-v2 on DoomCube Discord)
- 1515 corner brackets (see [micron-v2 github](https://github.com/hartk1213/Micron2.4/blob/main/STLs/Frame/%5Ba%5D_1515_Corner_Bracket_x4.stl) )

All parts should be already be in print-ready orientation, and no supports are needed.

Standard Voron settings, or lowered infill and fewer perims, should work fine:
- 3-4 perimeters
- 16-40% infill, depending on the part
- 0.4-0.5 width
